# Tasks: YouTube Channel Connection & Video Processing

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-youtube-connection/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: Next.js 14 App Router structure
- Paths shown below follow plan.md structure
- All paths relative to repository root

---

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T010 Create initial database schema migration in supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql (churches, videos, transcripts, processing_jobs, oauth_tokens tables with church_id foreign keys)
- [ ] T011 Create Row Level Security policies migration in supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql (enforce church_id isolation on all tables)
- [ ] T012 Create pgvector extension setup migration in supabase/migrations/003_pgvector_setup.sql (enable extension, add embedding column to transcripts, create IVFFlat index)
- [ ] T013 Create database functions migration in supabase/migrations/004_functions.sql (token refresh function, video sync trigger)
- [ ] T014 [P] Generate TypeScript types from Supabase schema in lib/supabase/types.ts
- [ ] T015 [P] Implement token encryption utility in lib/utils/encryption.ts (AES-256 encrypt/decrypt for OAuth tokens)

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Enable Semantic Search (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Generate vector embeddings for all transcript segments to enable semantic search queries (prepares for Feature 002 Telegram bot)

**Independent Test**: After transcript completes, embeddings generate automatically, video status updates to "Indexed", pgvector similarity search returns relevant segments in <100ms

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Upload Generated Captions (Priority: P5)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Phase 3): Can start after Foundational - no dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (Phase 4): Depends on US1 (needs OAuth tokens to fetch videos)
  - US3 (Phase 5): Depends on US2 (needs videos in database to process)
  - US4 (Phase 6): Depends on US3 (needs transcripts to generate embeddings)
  - US5 (Phase 7): Depends on US3 (needs transcripts to upload as captions)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - BLOCKS US2
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (needs OAuth connection) - BLOCKS US3
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (needs video list) - BLOCKS US4 and US5
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on US3 (needs transcripts) - Independent from US5
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Depends on US3 (needs transcripts) - Independent from US4

### Critical Path

Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 (for Feature 002 Telegram bot)

US5 (Upload Captions) is optional and can be deferred

### Within Each User Story

- Foundation tasks before story-specific tasks
- API routes before UI components that call them
- n8n workflows before API routes that trigger them
- Utilities before features that use them
- Core implementation before error handling and polish

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003-T009 can run in parallel
**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T014-T019 can run in parallel (after migrations complete)
**Phase 3 (US1)**: Tasks T021-T022, T025 can run in parallel
**Phase 4 (US2)**: Tasks T032-T033 can run in parallel
**Phase 5 (US3)**: Tasks T039-T041, T046 can run in parallel
**Phase 6 (US4)**: Task T053 can run while other tasks are being planned
**Phase 7 (US5)**: Tasks T062, T064 can run in parallel
**Phase 8 (Polish)**: Most tasks T068-T078 can run in parallel

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (YouTube OAuth connection)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Video library display)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test connection ‚Üí video list flow
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Delivers**: Administrators can connect YouTube and see their video library

### Full Feature (User Stories 1-4)

1. Complete Phases 1-4 (MVP)
2. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Transcript processing)
3. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (Embedding generation)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test full pipeline Connect ‚Üí Sync ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Index
5. Deploy (blocks Feature 002 - Telegram bot)

**Full Feature Delivers**: Complete knowledge base ready for Telegram queries

### Optional Enhancement (User Story 5)

1. Complete Phases 1-6 (Full Feature)
2. Complete Phase 7: User Story 5 (Caption upload)
3. Complete Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
4. Production deployment with all features

### Incremental Delivery

1. Week 1: Setup + Foundational + US1 ‚Üí Demo OAuth connection
2. Week 2: US2 ‚Üí Demo video library
3. Week 3: US3 ‚Üí Demo transcript processing
4. Week 4: US4 ‚Üí Demo embedding generation (Feature 002 ready)
5. Week 5: US5 + Polish ‚Üí Production deployment

Each week delivers independently testable value

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:
- Developer A: US1 + US2 (OAuth and video sync)
- Developer B: US3 (Transcription pipeline) - can start US3 backend while A finishes US2 UI
- Developer C: US4 (Embeddings) - can start while B works on US3
- Developer D: Polish items (i18n, documentation, testing)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable at its checkpoint
- Database migrations (T010-T013) must run sequentially in order
- n8n workflows (T028, T042, T054) require MCP access to deploy
- Commit after completing each phase or logical task group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- US4 completion unblocks Feature 002 (Telegram AI assistant)

**Total Tasks**: 85
**MVP Tasks (US1-2)**: T001-T038 (38 tasks, ~2 weeks)
**Full Feature Tasks (US1-4)**: T001-T061 (61 tasks, ~4 weeks)
**All Tasks with Polish**: T001-T085 (85 tasks, ~5-6 weeks)
