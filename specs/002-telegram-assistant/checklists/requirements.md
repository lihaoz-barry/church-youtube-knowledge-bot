# Specification Quality Checklist: Telegram AI Knowledge Assistant

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality gates met

**Clarifications Resolved**: 0 (none required)

**Specification Statistics**:
- User Stories: 5 (P1-P5, all independently testable)
- Functional Requirements: 48 (FR-001 through FR-048)
- Success Criteria: 12 measurable outcomes
- Edge Cases: 10 documented scenarios
- Assumptions: 12 clearly stated

**Dependencies**:
- Requires Feature 001 (YouTube Connection) to be implemented first
- Bot cannot function without processed videos and transcript embeddings

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (recommended next step)

## Notes

This feature implements the final piece of the Connect → Process → Query pipeline. It depends on:
1. Video transcripts being available (Feature 001)
2. Embeddings generated for all transcript segments (Feature 001)
3. pgvector search capability configured in database (Feature 001)

The specification maintains technology-agnostic language in user-facing sections while documenting technical assumptions separately.
